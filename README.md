# InstaCompare
Simple C# program to compare followers and following lists, because Instagram's API sucks...

Have you ever wanted to know if there are people that don't follow you back, or people that you don't follow back? Well with this program it has now become easier than ever.
Because Instagram's native API is so limiting (i.e., it can't do anything with personal accounts), I've been thinking about a way to compare followers and following lists.
This works by extracting JSON data from your data your request from Instagram. This means it is not dynamic so use the most recent data pulled from the site. 

TODO:
- write JSON parsers
- figure out how to organize and display output
